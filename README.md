# video-object-detection
This repository contains a Python script for reading frames from a 10-minute video, detecting objects in each frame using the YOLO model, and saving the cropped images of detected objects into a specified folder.

## Overview

This repository contains the files required for the video object detection assignment. The assignment involves processing a video to detect and save cropped images of objects found in each frame.

## Files

- **`input_video.mp4`**: The input video file used for object detection.
- **`object_detection.py`**: Python script for performing object detection on the video.
- **`coco.names`**: File containing class labels for object detection.
- **`yolov3-spp.cfg`**: Configuration file for the YOLO model.
- **`yolov3-spp.weights`**: Pre-trained weights for the YOLO model.
- **`cropped_images/`**: Folder where cropped images of detected objects will be saved.
- **`output_images/`**: Folder where output frames with detected objects will be saved.
